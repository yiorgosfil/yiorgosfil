### Hi there 🕊️

#### I am Yiorgos - A Fullstack Developer settled in Amsterdam

- I'm presently developing a personal project—a web app for project and inventory management—using ⚛️ React and NodeJS.
- 🌿 I'm also broadening my skills in Next.js by working on an Airbnb clone.
- 📖 I'm in the process of learning Python for back-end applications.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I find relaxation in yoga 🧘‍♂️ and meditation during my breaks.
